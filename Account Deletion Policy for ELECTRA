Welcome to ELECTRA. This document provides users with the necessary steps to request the deletion of their B.Link account and associated data.

About ELECTRA

ELECTRA is a mobile application that works with intercom systems, allowing users to receive calls from their buildingâ€™s intercom directly on their phone. When a call comes in, users can:
- Answer the call
- Open the door remotely
- Decline the call
The call is accompanied by a video feed from the intercom, so users can see who is at the entrance before taking action.

Additionally, ELECTRA offers the following features:
- Live video monitoring: Users can check the entrance area at any time.
- Photo capture: Take snapshots from the intercom camera.
- Device management: Configure and adjust settings for connected devices.
- User invitations: Users can invite family members or others, allowing them to also receive and manage intercom calls from their phones.

Steps to Delete Your Account:

Remove All Devices: Log into the ELECTRA app and go to the edit profile section.

Once your account deletion request is completed:
All data associated with your account, including personal information, device configurations, and activity history, will be permanently deleted from ELECTRA servers.
